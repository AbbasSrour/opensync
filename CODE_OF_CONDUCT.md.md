# OpenSync Code of Conduct

## Our pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the OpenSync community a harassment free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical address or an email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, pull requests, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

Project spaces include, but are not limited to:

- GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and code reviews
- Project documentation and community content
- Any official community chats or event spaces used by this project

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it as soon as possible.

Preferred reporting paths:

1. Contact the repository owner on GitHub: @waynesutton
2. Contact any maintainer listed in this repository (if a maintainers file exists)
3. If you need an escalation path outside the project, you can report the behavior to GitHub Support

When reporting, include:

- A description of what happened
- Links or screenshots, if available
- Any relevant context (where it happened, when it happened, who was involved)
- Whether you feel unsafe or need urgent help

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. We will respect the privacy and security of the reporter to the extent possible.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including moderation, temporary restrictions, or permanent bans, to address behavior that violates this Code of Conduct.

## Enforcement guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct.

### 1. Correction

Community impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

Consequence: A private, written warning from maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

Community impact: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in project spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary ban

Community impact: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

Consequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent ban

Community impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

Consequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
